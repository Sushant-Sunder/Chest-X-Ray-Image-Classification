Project Description

The global pandemic or COVID-19 outbreak has an immense impact on the health of humans all over the globe. This pandemic affected the lives of the people. We have seen various testing techniques initially based on genetic material i.e. physical testing to testing with the help of artificial intelligence and deep learning through chest X-ray images. In this model, I have analyzed and compared the performance of some of the pre-trained models on datasets containing chest X-rays. The models used for analysis are Resnet101, Xception, VGG16, and a custom model. Apart from this comparison, I tried to observe the resemblance of COVID disease with other existing lung diseases. The comparison will be with 14 different classes of lung disease and observing resemblance of COVID with them.
